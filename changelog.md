## Week 1

- App database created. The app adds an sql file to the user's machine upon running the app.

## Week 2

- User UI progressing, using PySimpleGUI library
- Service functions for operations are in progress. They communicate with the sql backend
- User can add a pack of cards to the database
- User can fetch the data using the service function

## Week 3

- Testing started with high percentage, tested only service functions not the UI
- Code refactored to work better (all the pages work together correctly etc...)
- User UI nearly done, most desired user actions can be done
- User can add packs, delete them, and play the memory game on the UI.
